\begin{problem}
 Prove that $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{C}\minus\{0\}$ are Homeomorphic by Zariski topology. 
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
 Since $\card \mathbb{C}=\card \mathbb{C}\minus \{0\}$, there is a bijection $f:\mathbb{C}\to \mathbb{C}\minus\{0\}$. Then we prove $f$ is homeomorphism. 
 
 First, we prove a set is closed iff it's finite or it's Universe. For a finite set $A$, obviously $V((\prod_{t\in A}(x-t)))=A$ is closed. For closed set $A=V(I),I\neq (0)$, consider $f\in I\minus\{0\}$, we know $\forall a\in A,f(a)=0$, so $A$ is finite. 

 Since $f$ is bijection, we know $f$ preserve the cardinality, so preserve finite set. And $f(\mathbb{C})=\mathbb{C}\minus\{0\}$, so $f$ preserve closed set. For the same reason $f^{-1}$ preserve closed set. So $f$ is homeomorphism.  
\end{solution}

 Let $D_f:=\{h\in \mathcal{O}_v(V)\}$
